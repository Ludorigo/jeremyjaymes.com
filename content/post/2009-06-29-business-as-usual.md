Take a bit of time to get started before you can take the time to give up.

Regardless of what the late night television commercials or the one page web sites might claim, the internet is not going to make you rich overnight. Sure there is a pot of gold to be found but it&#8217;s not going to jump into your lap, it&#8217;s going to take hard work and a good map to find it.

In theory I don&#8217;t think business and entrepreneurship on the web is any different than the traditional form of business you might be used to. Sure the avenues through which you foster and realize success may behave in a drastically different way, the tactics are not what you are used to, but the principles by which you succeed remain relatively unchanged. If you are willing to adapt. It is going to take hard work, dedication, and a good plan. Just like you had to learn how to market your business through traditional avenues you will again need to learn to market your business through the rapidly changing avenues that make up the world wide web.

The amount of cash need to fund this start up may seem minute in comparison to what you may have doled out to start something similar brick and mortar style, but the building of the business is the same none the less. You wouldn&#8217;t close up shop at the first sign of trouble on the outside, you can&#8217;t be so quick to close up shop in the inside.

Devise a plan, put aside time and money for marketing, take time to learn the business and get all of your ducks in a row. Business is business, regardless of whether it be conducted on the internet or on the street.
