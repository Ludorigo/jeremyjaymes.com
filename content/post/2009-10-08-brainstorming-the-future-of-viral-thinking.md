When I first purchased the domain, ViralThinking.com over a year ago I had big plans, loved the name and saw a great idea. That idea has never exactly been given the chance to materialize. While I have more than enough on my plate to keep me busy at the moment and I have quite often considered letting this domain slide, there is still a drive to make something great of it.

Having just recently started a personal blog at jeremyjaymes.com I have come to realized that sharing my own personal ideas and business experiences in two places would be overkill. So I started brainstorming in an attempt to pin down where viral thinking could fit into all of this. Then I started to think back to how it all started.

What I wanted to create with Viral Thinking was a place that focused on small business ideas, experiences and startups not necessarily of my own creation. A place where people could share and discuss those ideas and experiences as a learning experience.

While I am still not exactly sure how that might look at this point the seed is planted and I am ready to move forward.

Here is a quick breakdown of some thoughts I had, feel free to add your own ideas in the comments.

  * Interviews with entrepreneurs, inventors, innovators etc.
  * An open platform for people to come together and share ideas. (A community brainstorm perhaps.)
  * Twitter integration of some sort???
  * Tips

That&#8217;s the short version. I would love to hear some thoughts on this, perhaps you would like to be involved somehow? I would definitely be interested in people looking to contribute in the early stages and as it grows (we hope).
