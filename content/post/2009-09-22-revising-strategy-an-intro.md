A new revision of JeremyJaymes.com, welcome. I have been struggling with the idea of starting yet another blog for quite a few months now. Over the weekend and in light of a few recent events I decided that it is now time to begin experimenting with new strategy. I have started to formulate a plan that is the driving force behind this decision to start a &ldquo;self-branded” blog, but I am not yet willing to disclose the idea… entirely.

I will continue to blog about all things related to the business of design and development at Papertree Design. While I may at times have cross-over articles I am going to try and keep the content separate. I am also going to put the Viral Thinking blog on hold and possibly start porting certain pieces over to this blog with the idea that it may be no more. Lastly I will not be “streaming life” here anymore. While it is fun to share everything in one place I don&#8217;t feel it really does much for me. I belong to each one of these social areas for one reason or another and I prefer that the connections stay there (if you want to join me, check the footer).

In a nutshell it&#8217;s going to be about ideas. Ideas that I have on business, design, innovation and so forth which I feel fall outside the scope of what belongs in writing on Papertree Design. The writing will be categorized but pretty loose and minimal. Thus the lack of a by category organizational structure. I will also go sans search for right now as part of an experiment. The site will adapt accordingly. More to come&hellip;
