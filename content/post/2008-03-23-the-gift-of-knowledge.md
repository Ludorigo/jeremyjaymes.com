A few days ago, with eight hours of solo driving ahead of me I started to let my mind wander towards my future. I asked myself the question; what would I like to be doing 20 years from now. Regardless of what goals came to mind a singular idea continued to creep it&#8217;s way into all of my plans, teach others. It became apparent to me that I hope to be accomplished enough in at least one area of my life so that I am able to pass on knowledge to a younger generation. I envisioned myself speaking in front of large crowds, working with small groups of children eager to learn, even writing a book. It&#8217;s when I started to realize how important the &#8220;gift of knowledge&#8221; has become to me.

I don&#8217;t feel that ones only goal in attaining knowledge should be for the sole purpose of their own success. I feel that the knowledge should be readily available and openly shared. Bits of knowledge are like pieces of a never ending puzzle. There are an infinite number of ideas out there waiting to be discovered but without the proper pieces some of them may be missed or worse yet forgotten about all together. I may never find myself on the verge of the next great discovery, but if something that I have captured through my own trials assists another in doing so, then I will have completed my portion of the puzzle.

This particular creation of mine, this blog, Viral Thinking is what one piece toward completing my portion of the puzzle. My knowledge of business may be limited when compared to that of others,Â  but if I can help one person to learn from my failures and accomplishments then I will have done my job in contributing to the greater gift of knowledge.

It is a satisfying feeling to know you might contribute to anothers success. In the process of sharing what you have learned in the past you will even find that you begin to learn something about yourself or your business that you may have overlooked at one time or another. I encourage you to start considering your own wealth of knowledge as a piece of the puzzle.
