It was inevitable that I find myself once again on my own to explore the world of entrepreneurship. I guess this could be considered my first official announcement concerning my new &#8220;freelancing freedom&#8221;. A few weeks into taking my recent job as a web designer I began to gain a certain confidence in my ability and started to realize the potential for &#8220;going it alone&#8221;. I guess you could say that the thought had been blooming in the back of my mind, however I wanted to really do it right this time, prepare my self for the switch. I had leapt into it before and learned from my mistakes. Preparation is key. So when I started to recognize the possibility of a potential problem arising that could threaten the future of my employment security I took subtle steps to lay a foundation. You may have seen [Papertree Design][1] spring up almost overnight, and then the complimentary [Waukesha Web Designer][2] began taking shape, subtle advertising moves, the search for new clients and my need to soak up knowledge like a bone dry sponge. The employment problems I mentioned unfolded before me almost as though I had written them into being. Frightening to imagine, but what it has shown me is that my knowledge and ability to analize a business is growing stronger. So hear I am back on track and where I believe I am meant to be, &#8220;self employed&#8221; and a whole hell of a lot more confident about my ability to succeed.

What that means? Well for one it will give me a much broader range of topics to choose from and a whole new set of solutions to present for the readers of Viral Thinking. It also means that in addition to creating a brand new entrepreneurial adventure I will have time to devote to other ideas that had been put on the back burner. I for one know a particular clothing company that could really use my help to get back on it&#8217;s feet right now.

It is an exciting time for me and I can not wait to share!
