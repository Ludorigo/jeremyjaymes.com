For a long time I have been struggling with ViralThinking.com and what to do with it. I know you are more than likely unfamiliar with the site, it is a blog I started way back around the time I owned an apparel start-up. The plan was to share ideas about marketing, branding, design and the various other aspects of business I had picked up along the way. More of a personal outlet I suppose.

When I made the decision to break off on my own I had to begin devoting 100% of my time to establishing Papertree Design and thus any efforts I put into Viral Thinking ceased to exist. Since the initial push to establish Papertree I have found myself coming back to Viral Thinking on several occasions trying to decide if I should make a go at it or change directions completely. There it sits and it is time for me to admit that the original project is dead in the water.

Papertree is doing well, I have started this blog and I have a handful of other ventures I am in the process of planning. Time to leave it alone. There are however a good number of what I feel are decent articles on Viral, therefore I have made the decision to slowly start porting them over to this blog in an attempt to save some of the knowledge I have shared in the past.

Over the next several weeks and possibly months you will see a slow migration of some of the articles worth saving. I am hoping to gain more exposure for them here and would love to get your feedback.

Thanks for listening, have a great Thanksgiving Day!

One last addition, with that I will be cleaning up and slightly modifying the theme used on [Viral Thinking][1] in order to release it. It is a WordPress theme.
