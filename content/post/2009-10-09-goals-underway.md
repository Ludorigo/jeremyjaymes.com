Last post I talked about setting some long term goals. I also mentioned that I would reveal them as they got underway. Since then I have started moving forward with a few of them and it&#8217;s time to reveal.

The first one is a biggie. We have decided to undertake the remodeling of an old farm house that is around 100 yrs old (give or take). Starting small and little by little we are going to make it happen. While I feel that I am pretty handy it&#8217;s sure to be a learning experience to say the least. Overall I am super excited about it and look at it as more of a hobby as opposed to hard work. I have always dreamt of doing something like this and I am super excited to get the opportunity.

Since I am going to be undertaking this operation I decided I needed to have a journal of the progress. I also figured it might be pretty cool to make it public so people could kind of peak over my shoulder. (Like I said a learning experience.)

So here it is [&ldquo;Our Weekend Project&rdquo;][1], on tumblr of course!

Goal number two: I would love to be involved in some sort of teaching or coaching down the line. I truly enjoy talking to people about what I do or something I am good at. While I am sure that I will have many an opportunity as my son grows older, I have decided to put this one further down the list because I <del>don&#8217;t</del> didn&#8217;t expect it to happen over night. No sooner said, did I receive an interesting opportunity to participate in Disability Mentoring Day with a few students from my old high school.

While it is more or less a one day opportunity, I look at it as an exciting start. I am so excited to just sit down and listen to what these students have to say. What there dreams are. What they want to learn. I plan to answer any questions I can and hopefully provide them some solid advice. If I can work my way into it being a regular occurrence I will certainly welcome the opportunity.

That&#8217;s it for now, but it goes to show you, if you sit down and commit yourself to some goals you can make them happen.
