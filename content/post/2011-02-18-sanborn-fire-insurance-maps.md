An amazing collection of Sanborn Fire Insurance Maps from the late 1800&#8217;s, early 1900&#8217;s. The author has isolated the beautiful lettering and ornament from the map titles. I was delighted to see that someone also linked out to a Milwaukee collection ([curated by UW-Milwaukee][1]) in the comments.
