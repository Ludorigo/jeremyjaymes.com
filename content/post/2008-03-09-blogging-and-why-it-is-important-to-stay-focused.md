How many are we up to now? Double, triple digit millions of blogs out there. A bit of an overwhelming number to compete with it would seem. So how do you carve out your niche and retain a loyal readership month after month? Stay focused! When you first set out to create your blog you did it for a reason, whether to vent to anyone that would listen, to cover a topic the you felt was starving for attention or even as a means to drive traffic to your already established online business. Whatever the case may be, you had a goal in mind and that goal deserves your attention.

I would like to expand on this a bit by taking a look at a piece of advice passed down to me by my brother. One that he stands by when it comes to creating a blog was lucky enough to spend a  considerable amount of time discussing with one very influential and profitable writer in the blogging world. Focus! Now that is not to imply that your particular blog needs to be a laser focused niche blog, simply I am stating that you need to keep in mind why you created yor blog in the first place. Keep in mind the reader you where looking to reach out to in the begginging of it all and stay the course.

Your reader decided to visit your piece of web real estate for a reason, your blog seemed to be of value. So when you are writing do so as if you are on the verge of creating your first best selling novel. Make it a page turner one that they can not put down. The first chapter flowing seemlesly into the next and the next and before you know it they have spent over an hour digging through your archives itching for more. I know when I visit a well writen and interesting blog, mindpetals.com for instance, I can&#8217;t help put click on the next link down the page. I know it will at least be interesting, most likely inspirational and always well written.

There is nothing wrong with steering off course to go exploring once in a while, in fact I believe it is well worth providing your reader with a bit of a shock once in awhile, but in the end you should always steer back towards your final destination. Your reader will appreciate it and come back to follow along on your journey a bit more often.
