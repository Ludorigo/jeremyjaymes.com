I just finished sending of one of many emails to my brother discussing some of the exciting things I have been up to recently, one of them being the creation of Viral Thinking. Something I said in the opening paragraph struck me as important and I felt that it was worth sharing. I realized that one of the reason that I so often find myself looking to him when it comes to developing new ideas and proclaiming recent accomplishments is for the simple reason that he seems to be able to see things on a similar plane. I went further to discover that the reason I don&#8217;t feel it necessary to share the same ideas with a number of my close friends is for the simple fact that they just don&#8217;t really care. These are the people that are only willing to see the right here and now, the almighty dollar sign if you would like to break it down further. If it is not benefiting me financial, then isn&#8217;t it just kind of a hobby or even more so a complete waste of time. My point is that in order to become a viral thinker you need to be able to see the bigger picture, perhaps the future benefit of your actions and accomplishments. This quality is one of the many that sets true entrepreneurs apart from those who are happy and in some cases unhappy to be working for someone else. Not to say that every happy employee is not capable of seeing the bigger picture, what I am saying is that there are many who just don&#8217;t care to think about it, allowing only instant gratification to take over.
