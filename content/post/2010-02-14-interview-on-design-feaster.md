I had a wonderful opportunity to participate in an interview/questionnaire for [“Design Feaster: the Design Feast Blog”][1]. It was published early this past week and unfortunately due to my schedule having been overloaded with catch up work after being out sick for several days the week prior, I am only now getting around to writing a short blurb about the feature.

I really enjoyed participating in this questionnaire as it gives me yet another outlet to share some of my experience and thoughts, this time focusing on developing a blog and the writing process. As I state several times throughout the brief questionnaire, that is really what it is all about for me.

I highly recommend checking out both Design Feaster and [Design Feast][2] as well. Some very insightful and enjoyable writing being done here, a wonderful and much needed resource for the design community.

A special thanks to Nate Burgos of Design Feast for allowing me to participate.
