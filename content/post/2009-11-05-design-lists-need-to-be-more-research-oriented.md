If they need to **be** at all&hellip; While some of us certainly have good intentions when we compile the next list of &ldquo;20 of the Most Beautifully Designed Sites on the Web&rdquo;. Those intentions being that we would honestly like to share our inspiration with other designers and developers of the world. We have to realize that the widespread use of social sharing services such as Twitter allows these lists proclaiming what is good design to be similarly widespread. That in itself is not the problem. The problem lies in the fact that many of these lists are simply visuals of &ldquo;what is good design&rdquo; and fail to explain the reasons of why. This tends to lead many of our potential clients to believe that design is nothing more than a visual piece that just so happens to fall into place and look good while working well. 

While you and I might understand why some of these lists can be labeled as good design our client is not necessarily trained to do the same. Although we are looking to share this inspiration with the world we are in fact hurting ourselves by failing to delve deeper into the intricacies of the design and thus educating our clients. We are in a way further equating good design with good art.

I think that there is a more responsible way to approach this benefiting both designers and our potential clients. That is to be more research oriented if you must compile a list. While I appreciate access to a list of well design minimal sites for inspiration I would much rather see a shorter list combined with a thouhgtful piece on why this minimal website can be considered good design. What is it doing correctly to achieve the goals most likely set by the company, business or individual?

Approaching it like this allows me, your reader, to learn something and understand how I can implement similar techniques to produce results for my clients. My clients who have also read this article can now begin to understand why I might concentrate on and suggest improvements to a particular part of the design which may have otherwise gone overlooked. 

When it is all said and done, and the initial _look_ of the site has impressed everyone, the client is likely to become more focused on the results that it is or is not producing. What we, as a whole, need to do is concentrate more on how those results can be achieved through good design and what it takes to get us there.

That&#8217;s my opinion, what are your thoughts?
