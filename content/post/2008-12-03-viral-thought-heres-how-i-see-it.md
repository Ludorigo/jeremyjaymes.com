There are a few articles in circulation today regarding how and why you use twitter. My thoughts are this, use twitter for whatever you want, it is what you make of it. Twitter is hangout, it&#8217;s a networking event, it&#8217;s a party, it&#8217;s a marketing pitch. It is filled with hundreds upon thousands of attendees. There is gossip, there is chatter, ideas are being hashed out, companies being formed, products being pitched and friends being made. You don&#8217;t have to, nor could you hope to every be involved in every conversation that is going on at this huge event. Someone&#8217;s voice is annoying you, walk away. A conversation doesn&#8217;t interest you, move on. You are not being forced to clear your inbox of emails touting photos of &#8220;My sister&#8217;s hot friend&#8221;, you are simply interacting with those whom you choose to interact with.<!--more-->

So whether you have 1000&#8217;s of followers who have chosen to stick around even though they know the majority of tweets are links to your product, or you have just a few and your conversations are about what you are doing tomorrow, it makes no difference. The point is Twitter is an app made just for you, use it as you see fit.
