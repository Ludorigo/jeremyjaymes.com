The very reason for my somewhat infrequent posting is due to many business owners asking that very question, learning the answer and looking for help. Needless to say there are still probably quite a few out there whom do not yet have the answer but have heard about blogging and are interested in exploring it as a low cost marketing option during uncertain economic times. If you are one of the few that has not asked the question yet then perhaps it is time.

With that I would like to share with you a short but informative article I wrote quite awhile ago for a personal blog that has since gone by the wayside.

I was approached yesterday by a local business owner with an interesting question regarding the benefits of creating a company blog. The question: What are the benefits? Off the cuff I was able to provide a pretty good answer to the question but I felt as though there was more to discuss, so I did a bit of research last night and would like to expand on my ideas.

### Reason #1

First let me say that you as the business owner know your industry and customer better than anyone, you will know if a company blog will benefit them or create an unwanted hassle for you and your employees. Bottom line is, an effective blog requires some work beyond just good design and development. It requires work on your part as well. Articles or &#8220;posts&#8221; need to be well written, optimized and pitched as a real benefit to your customer, not just another advertisement for your product. If you approach your blog as creating a learning resource for your customer, it will be well received and ultimately benefit your business.

The benefits of a company blog are both up front and obvious as well as behind the scenes. Here are some of the up front reasons. The ability to share news and updates about your company on a regular basis going beyond the monthly or quarterly newsletter you may already have in place. Let&#8217;s be realistic, economically it does not make sense to send out a newsletter every time there is a new development and by the time your quarterly or monthly newsletter makes it&#8217;s way into the hands of the customer, some of your news may be outdated. With a blog your customer is able to check back at their own free will to keep updated on your company.

### Reason #2:

Reinforcing your brand and positioning yourself as an expert. Ok I could be a great sales person. I know just enough about my product, Widget A, in order to close the deal and make a comfortable living. However if I was viewed as someone that knows more than &#8220;just enough&#8221;, a real expert that could provide answers to your questions now and into the future, would I not be more likely to get your business? Constantly putting your brand in front of the customer, letting them know that not only do you create Widget A, but your know everything there is to know about Widget A, positions your company as an expert in the field. Translated: It makes your customer feel comfortable when purchasing your product.

### Reason #3:

Answering your customers question before they even walk through the door. Chances are your customer has some questions and they are more than likely to do some research of their own. If you are the one providing those much needed answers, who are they likely to come to first when making the final decision. Answering questions and providing value, reinforces your overall brand in the eyes of the customer.

### Reason #4:

Encouraging customer interaction and feedback. A blog is not just a place to share information, it is also a place to encourage interaction and feedback. Wouldn&#8217;t it be valuable to hear what your customers are saying.

### Reason #5:

Providing a more personal look at your company and the people within. Lets create an example here. You have two local hardware stores. Store 1 has everything you need and some pretty decent prices, problem is that when help is needed the employees seem to disappear, your questions seem more of an annoyance and when it comes time to check out the clerk might as well be a robot scanning your items. No smile and no friendly hello. Now Store 2 takes a different approach. They are always there to assist you with a smile on their face. They take the time to get to know you as a customer and in return you get to know them. They make you feel welcome. Let your customer get to know you before they walk in the door.

### Reason #6:

Identify with the community. You don&#8217;t need to set out to create a blog that is nationally known, instead focus on your community, your target market.

### Reason #7:

Working behind the scenes. A well written and functional blog creates fresh, useful content. Fresh useful content is considered valuable to search engines and can ultimately improve your ranking.

So that&#8217;s it, I have covered some of the key points to take into consideration when asking yourself the question. Would a blog be useful to my company? As I said the final decision is in your hands, as you know and understand your product and market best.
