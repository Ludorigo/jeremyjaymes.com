I decided that there are other areas on the web that need a bit more help than this particular site so I decided to go with a very minor redesign, in fact you probably don&#8217;t even notice. (Or it is possible that you have never been here and it really doesn&#8217;t make any difference to you anyway, that&#8217;s fine too.) I think the main thing I need to concentrate on is creating content, making you want to come read what I have to say. Besides I like the design, it&#8217;s nice clean and simple, makes for easy reading and focuses on the important stuff. Don&#8217;t get me wrong I like fancy graphics to but it just doesn&#8217;t fit here. Maybe I will add a nice little &#8220;gallery of inspiration&#8221; just to give it some zing.

Well happy reading!
