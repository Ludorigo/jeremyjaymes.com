I got excited the other day after speaking with my brother and hearing the news that he plans to rekindle the fire of his entrepreneurial vision. After a brief hiatus to focus on life, marriage and his career he has decided that now is the time to begin focusing on past projects and future ideas. &#8220;You got me motivated to get back at it.&#8221; he said over and over and that was just what I needed to hear. So I thought to myself how can we get the ball moving and keep it rolling this time. In the past we had relied on email, phone calls and even skype to ping ideas back and forth but with our hectic schedules and the enormous time difference between us it became hard to stay on top of it all. So how can we do this without the need for constant contact? And there it was collecting dust on my Firefox toolbar this whole time &#8211; <a href="http://www.backpackit.com" title="Backpack" target="_blank">Backpack</a>.

After inviting him as the one additional user that my free account allows I set out to explore how we could utilize this tool to keep the ideas flowing and the motivation at an all time high. With Backpack we are able to leave each other quick notes, go more in depth by attaching a full page document or &#8220;Writerboard&#8221;, create lists, and email each other reminders all on our own time regardless of the time zone or our current schedule. The possibilities for working together are now endless.

Lets say I wake up early one morning and jump out of bed with some hair brained idea that just might work, I switch on the computer log in to my Backpack account and begin a new writerboard enthusiastically spilling my idea all over the page. He awakes around five hours later Hawaii time that is (yes I&#8217;m jealous you have no idea what I&#8217;m staring out the window at) anyway he dusts off his computer and logs in to check out what I have added over the night. He can let me know what a brilliant idea it is that I have just come up with and add his two sense and from there the brainstorm session is started. Of course there are a ton of additional features that I have yet to explore but that is the short and simple version of why I see Backpack being useful to me.

Being able to share and discuss your ideas with others is essential to generating a good business concept and I highly recommend it, just be sure that you choose the right people. Maybe you to will soon have a need for a Backpack account.

Now I just have to figure out how to get him to start using this thing on the regular, no easy task, I will let you know how it goes.
