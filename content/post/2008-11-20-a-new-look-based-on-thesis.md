A few days back I wrote about rethinking Viral Thinking for the year 2009. Reviving this blog and allowing it to live up to it&#8217;s potential. After writing that article I set the ball in motion, first step being a new hosting provider (more on that in a minute). Second step was to create a simple yet elegant design as well as take the opportunity to take a certain theme for a spin, something I have been wanting to do for awhile. Enter the Thesis WordPress Theme. <!--more-->

I have always loved the Thesis WordPress Theme for it&#8217;s clean presentation, simple design and beautiful typography so I finally broke down and bought the developers license to see what was running under the hood. Thesis claims beautiful code, improved SEO&#8230; [&#8220;Thesis is the WordPress theme for serious online publishers][1][&#8220;][1] and I can&#8217;t think of a better place than Viral Thinking for giving it my own trial run . (Like I said in the past I won&#8217;t back a product unless I use it myself.) After having put together this fairly simply, yet beautiful design in about 6 or so hours last night utilizing both the custom css and custom functions files, how can I not be impressed.  Custom css and Custom functions, what in the world is that? Not to worry Chris has plenty of options for the non coder. Using the custom admin panels hooked into Thesis you can still very easily put together a great looking blog with ease.  It&#8217;s a brilliant package and one that so far has been well worth the money.

As if that wasn&#8217;t enough, in just a few short days Viral Thinking will be served up via the state of the art web host Media Temple!

Looking forward to the changes and looking forward to the year 2009! Time to get writing.
