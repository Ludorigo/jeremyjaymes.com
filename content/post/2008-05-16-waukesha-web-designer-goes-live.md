As many of you know I recently decided that I would hang my hat out as a freelance designer/developer in the world of the internet. Yes my hat rack is getting quite full these days but why not, it keeps me busy. So the next step in the process is of course finding the work, marketing myself. Over the weekend I started creating a brainstorm of how this might be accomplished. All along the words &#8220;focus on a niche&#8221; were echoing in the back of my head. Now I would love for that niche to eventually become &#8220;WordPress Designer/Developer&#8221;, but that may take a bit more time if I would like to do it correctly. So in the mean time I decided that I would focus on creating professional, usable websites for local business. Waukesha Wisconsin happens to be the area in which I reside so I needed a way to get the word out. And then it hit me, what type of domain name might catapult me to the top of the search rankings and make obvious the reason I was there. Believe it or not this little beauty was there for the taking, www.[waukeshawebdesigner.com][1]. I am not sure that it could get any more obvious than that. Now of course I don&#8217;t want to just grab the domain name and forward it to my portfolio, it just wouldn&#8217;t be right, I actually want to produce great content so my chances of staying on top are even better. With this blog I hope to inform local business of some of the advantages to creating a strong online presence and utilizing the tools the internet provides that can lead to increased productivity and marketing. I also hope to add a bit more technical information for those on the area living and working as web designers and last but not least I would like to become an area advocate for WordPress.

Bottom line here is I think this domain will provide me with a great opportunity to get my name out and a building block for things that I have planned. We shall see what happens, I encourage you to stop by the site often as the information will most likely be relevant to a much wider audience.
