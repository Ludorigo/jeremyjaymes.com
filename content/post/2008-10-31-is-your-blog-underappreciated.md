Stumbling throught the &#8220;blogoverse&#8221; the other day I happened upon this little gem entitled [&#8220;How You Can Help End the Problem of Blogs with Great Content and No Readers&#8221;][1] at Chuck Westerbrooks blog. The idea is to gather up a huge audience, some of the participants and some of them simply there to support the cause and have something interesting to read each and everyweek. Anyhow the group gets together by simply subscribing to the RSS feed at Chucks blog. Every two weeks a new blog will be chosen and fed to the participants who will then become dedicated readers for at least the two weeks to follow. With that number of readers stopping by everyday plus the possibility of some bigger names getting involved it would seem to me that the thing could go viral rather quickly. Blog Networking, nice! Can&#8217;t hurt to get involved, if nothing else you may be introduced to some very interesting content floating around out there and who knows you may become a dedicated reader long after the two weeks are up.<!--more-->

To me the idea sounds pretty interesting so you can count me in, besides I can&#8217;t wait to see what kind of content gets cycled through this little project. Kudos to Chuck for such a smart idea!
