It is not my desire to turn this blog into a place where I rant and rave about the aggravations I face in the business world, however, every once and awhile I run into something that needs to be shared. I actually decided to create this post after searching google trying to find a similar post so that I could give a prospective client a good answer. Here is the situation.

I recently contacted someone who had put an add online requesting some very simple web design work, around 5 pages nothing to spectacular, looking for a web designer that wants to add to their portfolio. (I should have seen the red flag there.) However being that I am in the early stages of branching off and taking on clients of my own outside of work I decided that I would reply. In my reply I gave a rough estimate that was quite low compared to what one might expect to charge for professional web design out of a bigger company. I also opened up the discussion for negotiation in my initial email but at no time did I indicate that I would be willing to do pro-bono work. The reply I received was &#8220;would you be willing to do it for free and add it to your portfolio?&#8221; Ok here is the kicker, this company advertised itself as a small finance company. So I stepped back and thought about how I should reply to this one, and here is what I came up with. My reply went something like this, &#8220;Unfortunately I am unable to take on this type of work right now, I apologize, I misunderstood your need.&#8221; Line 2: Unless of course you are in the business of giving out zero interest loans to small businesses, then we might be able to talk.&#8221; The reply I received was a bit funny but ended with &#8220;no problem I will find someone to do it for free.&#8221;

So why is it so appalling that I might suggest that they provide their service for free if they are requesting mine for no charge? Obviously I did not expect to get the job when I replied in the manner I did, but I wanted to make a point. The problem that I have here is that I run into this time and again, it seems as though there are a great number of business owners out there that greatly undervalue the work that we as designers and web developers do. In some ways I feel like the kid who used to do drawings of animals for his classmates because he happened to be pretty good at it for a 3rd grader. Odd thing is I imagine that a business would have no problem paying for ad space in the local business publication, so where is the line drawn that says design and development work is of lesser value than &#8220;real, paid advertising&#8221;. Yes I understand that you want to have a line on your business card that starts with the letters www but why not take full advantage of what that www can provide you. Believe it or not more people turn to the internet to find a business, product or service they are in need of than anywhere else. So what gives?

The sad truth is, he is absolutely right. He will in fact find some poor college student who just needs to add a few more work examples to his portfolio before he graduates and he or she will be more than happy to do it for free. I have no problem with that college student doing the work either, they will do what they have to do to get ahead and hang their hat out in the corporate world.

Sorry but web design and development is a service and yes some people actually do it as a full time job and even get paid pretty well. No we don&#8217;t all learn to do this after creating our first myspace profile, we actually read books and take classes to stay up on the latest technologies so that we can provide you with a website that will work as a viable business tool.

Now as a disclaimer, there are some instances in which I would create a website for free. Here area few off the top of my head. I would consider doing work for a viable non-profit organization for free. I would also be more than happy to create a blog design for a young cancer survivor who wants to share his story with the world and touch other children dealing with cancer. This is not an extensive list but you get the idea.

So my question is how do we combat this plague on our industry?
