_This article was originally published on Papertree Design in December of 2008 during my first year of freelancing. It now makes more sense that it appear on my personal site, moved here October 26, 2011_

I don&#8217;t often take the time to stop and talk about the business of freelancing itself, but I was inspired to do so this morning after reading an excellent little piece by David Airey, [Designing Through a Recession][1] In this article he explores how designers and especially freelancers are fairing the economic downturn the world is currently experiencing. I noted in my comment that it was nice to see how many designers had such positive outlook considering the economic condition. With a recession upon us, what lies ahead can be a daunting vision for any of us, especially the small business owner and the self employed. There is always that looming thought, &#8220;What if new jobs stop coming in?&#8221;.

My experience, it doesn&#8217;t have to be frightening at all, in fact the uncertainty should breed new life into your creative mind. Both in your work and in your approach to business. The business is out there, both new and existing clients are in need of work the challenge is figuring out how you might appeal to that need during a time when most of them are tightening up the budget.

Here is an interesting trend I have noticed over the past several months. A lot of the requests I have been receiving come from professionals who for some reason or another have been adversely effected by the economic downturn. It may have been layoff or it may be that they are looking to beat their current employer to the punch. Needless to say they are in search of something new, something different and instead of moving down the street to the competing marketing firm they are looking to go it alone. Instead of facing the uncertainty that might come with a new job they are turning to entrepreneurship and staring uncertainty straight in the face.

So what does that mean. That means start-ups and new business which in turn have the need for your services. These clients understand the need for spending a little when it comes to their new brand, a lesson learned from their previous employer of 15 years. They know that a well designed logo and equally well designed business card are an important part of marketing and conveying a professional appearance. They may not understand the how but they know that the web is quickly becoming one of the most important tools available for fostering new business and they are not afraid to budget for it.

Finally why is that good for you, the freelancer? Because that budget has been created especially for you. Their new start-up of freelance consultancy has the need for quality work but may not be able to afford the 10 person design firm to head up the project. You being a freelancer can offer them quality work at lower cost due to the lack of overhead. You, are the perfect fit.

The business is without a doubt there, get creative, get innovative and go find it.
