I was out on the road before dawn yesterday giving me the chance to catch a very interesting piece on a morning radio show. The host talked about positioning yourself for success, creating and environment which allows you to realize your potential and preparing yourself to seize opportunity should it present itself. He stated that it is better to be well prepared and never to be presented with opportunity than to be unprepared and let opportunity escape.

In business, employment and life in general we often form an idea of how we would like to see things turn out, ideally. We even go so far as to visualize the certain milestones needed to achieve that
  
&#8220;end-point&#8221; But the question is are you prepared to seize that life changing opportunity should it present itself?

Being prepared starts with being able to see the big picture, seeing that end point and mentally working yourself backward from there. Take a minute, sit back, close your eyes and visualize your business in 5, 10 or 20 years. Hold that picture in your head and open your eyes. Begin jotting down a brief summary of what you saw. You have just effectively created a rough outline the your goals.

Now begin working your way back through time paying close attention to certain milestones that have allowed you to reach that end result. Was it when the local newspaper gave you an outstanding review, driving customers through the door in droves. Or perhaps it was when you were able to produce and ship 100,000 product units to a first time customer by the due date creating a lifelong business partnership. You have just created a list of possible opportunities.

With your goals clearly set and the milestones needed to reach those goals roughed out you can now begin to take the necessary steps to seize that golden &#8220;opportunity&#8221;. Whether it be to take a night class to learn a new skill or make plans to purchase a more efficient technology it is never to late to better prepare yourself, that is until the opportunity is knocking on your door.
