My third step in attempting to reach my goal has been to begin scouring the far corners of the internet for my customers and letting them know that I am here. With a big sale going on, the formation of the street team and some exciting changes in the works, we have a lot to talk about so why not do it. It&#8217;s quite obvious that it is a lot easier and even more profitable in the long run if you go out and find your customers instead of hanging around and waiting for them to come to you. There are only a couple of professions in this world that allow you the luxury of doing so and to my knowledge this isn&#8217;t one of them.

So today I got out there and started shouting at the tops of my lungs to anyone that would listen, posting in classified ads, social networking groups, and msg boards. Searching out forums or even better finding blogs related to your niche can certainly be a bit more targeted, however they often follow somewhat tighter guidelines when it comes to posting and linking. If you do get the green light be sure to include a tag-line with your URL, better yet target the link to a specific product the group might find of interest. I also plan to contact a few people I have established a good working relationship with in hopes that they will lend a hand in getting the word out. If I take nothing else away from this portion of the exercise I have learned that it is always a good idea to begin establishing friendships in this business from the get go because you never know when you may need their help. Networking I believe it is called.

The results so far: quite a spike in traffic for the better part of the daylight hours. One thing I will point out from past experience is that traffic seems to slow down quite noticeable Friday through early Sunday afternoon when you are dealing with this particular target market I am quite sure you can understand why. Which reminds me, what am I doing sitting in at 11pm this Friday evening?
