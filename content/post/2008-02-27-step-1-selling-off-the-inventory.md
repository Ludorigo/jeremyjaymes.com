First step in achieving sales of $500 a month, sell off old inventory at rock bottom prices. Out with the old and in with the new, a philosophy I have lived by for over half my life. At this point there is no sense in allowing the older product to sit around and take up shelf space when that shelf space could be better utilized to house new fresh product. Although I may fail to realize the items full profit potential I feel that some gain is better than none and I can use that gain to produce new items that I am just dying to put out there. This practice could turn out to be very beneficial in a variety of ways not only paying off immediately but having a lasting effect down the road. Why?

1. Page views, buzz and exposure. What are the majority of internet shoppers looking for online? A sale, products that are cheaper than that which they can buy offline. And what do they do when they find a great deal? Most likely they will tell at least one other person in their social network and by that I am not referring simply to MySpace or Facebook.

2. Creating repeat customers and retaining subscribers. Not every person that makes a purchase will choose to opt in to our newsletter, however the odds are now increased a bit. Each new customer has the choice and given that choice we are looking for about a 50% sign up rate. What have I just created? A list of people who can get excited about future products and promotions for months to come.

3. Working Capital. Product that sits around on the shelf is not producing any return for you whatsoever and although you may forfeit potential profit up front the possibility of losing your entire initial investment becomes much greater as time goes on. So why not cut your potential loses and produce some workable income that can be better invested a newer more desired product. Trends are changing daily so pay attention and know when to liquidate.

4. Exposure &#8211; I want to touch on this once more. For me it means getting the product out there on real everyday people, people who are going to at one time or another come in contact with friends who perhaps share the same interests, styles and tastes. Do see the possibility of a new customer knocking on your door?

Ok, so here is the plan. We will feature one t-shirt a week for ten dollars a pop until they are gone utilizing word of mouth to get the sale out there. No financial investment just our precious time. I will begin tracking the outcome at the end of week one. By my calendar that means next Wednesday the 5th.
