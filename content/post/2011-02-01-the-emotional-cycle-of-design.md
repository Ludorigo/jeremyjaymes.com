An excellent (and personally inspiring) article written by Matt Ward at Echo Enduring on &#8220;the Emotional Cycle of Design&#8221;. The ups and downs that I am sure many of us face when approaching a new project. I know that my attitude goes from enthusiasm to doubting that I was even the right guy for the job and back again. Sometimes more than once during a project life cycle.

From the conclusion:

> More importantly, though, if we can also learn to see past the incompleteness of a design and rest confident in the fact that it will get better, then perhaps we can also circumvent the cycleâ€”at least partially.
