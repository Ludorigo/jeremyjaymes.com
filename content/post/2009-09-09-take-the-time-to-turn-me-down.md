> &ldquo;I wanted to say thank you for taking the time to put together this very detailed proposal for us. We have made the decision to go with another firm.&rdquo;

Total time spent: under 20 secs in comparison to several hours/days on our end. Is that too much to ask?

I am well aware that there are more than a few tire kickers out there, 9 times out of 10 you can spot them a mile away. I do my best to avoid them and for the most part I would say that my intuition is fairly accurate. In short I try to be selective, spending a good deal of time on a proposal only when I believe there is a chance that a potential client is looking for value in that price tag. With that being said, I encourage competition and have no problem being outbid. But is it too much to ask for a moment of your time in repsonse?

It is this lack of simple courtesy in the business world that can at times, really grind my gears.
