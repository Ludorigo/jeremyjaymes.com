I am going to try something out that I implemented a while back on Papertree Design. Short little posts sharing something exciting and or brilliant that I found over the course of the week.

If you don&#8217;t know, I am pretty active on Twitter and have adopted the habit of reading a lot of what comes across my twitter stream. That&#8217;s what I get for following interesting people. (If you are a client of mine, not to worry, I use Instapaper so I can continue to get the work done on time.)

Anyhow in thinking about where to go with this blog I have been diving into a lot of business blogs and startup articles lately. One I found particularly motivating was this one on the Outright.com blog.

_For those of you that are not familiar with Outright I highly recommend you check it out. It has made the otherwise boring and laborious task of accounting extremely easy for my small business. (boring is my opinion, I&#8217;m not a numbers guy.)_

Anyhow it talks about taking risks in small business and why you should be doing it. I particularly like the portion about Co-Branding. Personally I think it super important for the small business or sole proprietor to form good relationships and partnerships with others inside and outside of their own market. Like they say, you can&#8217;t do it all yourself. Having these strategic partnerships can do wonders for moving your business forward.

Enough from me, have a look at the article [Why You’re Not Taking Risks with Your Small Business (And Why You Should)][1]
