A project and initiative attempting to establish a format for giving credit and revealing the people involved in the creation of a website by adding a simple file to the sites directory, humans.txt. I would live to see this catch on. Besides offering an unobtrusive way to establish credit for those that have worked hard to build a site as well as the tools used, it also provides a valuable resource for those that might take over or take the place of some of the initial team members. (Check out the example included on the site.)
