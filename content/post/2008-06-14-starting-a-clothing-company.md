From time to time I get an email asking for my advice on starting a clothing company. Why you might ask, well for those of you that don&#8217;t know, I created this little [gem][1]. Anyhow back to the point. I also frequent the Young Entrepreneur forums and it seems like about 1 out of every ten questions addresses some sort of clothing company startup related issue. Now in the past I have published several emails and &#8220;interviews&#8221; regarding how to go about starting a clothing company and the steps I tookÂ  because the fact is I love to talk about it. I am far from creating a super successful company, but I have learned quite a bit and made plenty of mistakes along the way. So as I get ready to reel ASONE Clothing back in for a bit and start fresh with a relaunch, plus help a family member getting something of their own rolling, I feel that it is time to start devoting some effort to putting some information out there for the rest of you.

It is a hard business to crack into and with new companies coming and going on a monthly basis I don&#8217;t necessarily suggest it as one you try for yourself, but I am never one to crush a dream and chances are you are going to give it a shot anyway. Consider this my official announcement and the lead off to a whole series of articles regarding &#8220;how to start a clothing company&#8221;.
