It&#8217;s a lazy Sunday and in typical fashion I am thinking about the week ahead. Projects on tap, daily business, marketing, book keeping, but I am also thinking about my blog(s) and what I will be writing over the week ahead. So I got to thinking about was has kept me inspired over the past few weeks since I decided to get back on top of blogging. Here&#8217;s a short list.

**Twitter** Inspiration abounds on Twitter if you are following the right people and by that I am talking about the people discussing topics relevant to your niche. Pay attention to what people are talking about, follow a link or two and I almost guaranty you will find something worth writing about.

**Pick Up a Book** Or a newspaper, or a magazine. Over the past few weeks, with a renewed devotion to blogging, I have stumbled upon more than one topic by simply reading a book. I&#8217;m not talking about a full on book review, I am just talking about a simple chapter or even a paragraph that has sparked the imagination and given me reason to write.

**Get out and see the world** That&#8217;s a bit of an exaggeration, but what I mean is take some time to see what&#8217;s going on in the community around you. Pay attention to what people are talking about, eavesdropping I guess you might call it. There are always people out there talking about the economy, how they just discovered Twitter or how they can&#8217;t seem to get their business off the ground.

**Watch a Video, TV Program, Movie** Several Topics have come to me while watching the evening news, think about it these are the things that are somewhat relevant in the world today. These are the topics that people are interested in learning more about.

Go now, find your own topics to right about, they are everywhere!
