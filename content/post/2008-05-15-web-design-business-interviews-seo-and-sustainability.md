If you have taken the time to stop in at [Papertree Design][1] you will see that I have been keeping plenty busy both at work and taking on freelance projects in my &#8220;spare time?&#8221;. I have also had some exciting developments with AS|ONE Clothing, with a new east coast sales rep coming on board. Oh and as you can probably see, somewhere in the midst of all that I managed to redesign Viral Thinking. I felt that if I was going to hang my hat out as a freelance web designer than at the very least my own websites should be of my creation. You can read more about this at [The Viral Thinking (Re)Design][2]. So where to go from here?

Well it is time for me to get back on top of things and begin frequently posting on Viral Thinking. Recently I added two brief interviews that I conducted with student at USC and I would very much like to expand on this and get the interviewers themselves involved in the discussion. I have asked for a final copy of the project itself and hope that with their permission I am able to publish excerpts. I think that this particular topic is of much interest to many of you. It seems from my experiences that so many of today&#8217;s companies, or at least their advertising campaigns are geared towards the skate/surf/snowboard demographic. Now I don&#8217;t always agree with some of the ways people portray the industry when pitching their product, however it appears as though this industry will remain in the lime lite for some time to come.

I would also like to begin posting more concerning SEO practices. I have been doing a lot of SEO experimentation lately with some of the sites I have been a part of creating, and I am very pleased with the results. My journey into the world of SEO is only just beginning and I hope to share all of my knowledge with you as I progress.

Lastly but certainly not least is the issue of the environment and how it is affected by your business practices. As we see buzzwords like green and sustainable carving out a place in our everyday culture, I feel that it is necessary to analyze these topics on a up close and personal basis.

Hope that some of these topics will be of interest to you!
