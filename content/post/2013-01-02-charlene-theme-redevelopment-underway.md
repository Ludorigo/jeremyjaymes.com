Three and a half years ago, give or take six months I released my first freely available WordPress theme. Being a bit less than confident at the time I never pushed it to the theme repository on WordPress.org but it managed to get a bit of attention with somewhere around 8000 downloads to date. It&#8217;s still available at <http://papertreedesign.com/themes> but as the notice clearly states, it&#8217;s not been updated for at least a year.

Well&#8230; I&#8217;m making an effort to change that. I just downloaded a fresh copy, opened it up in Coda and plan to get to work immediately. It&#8217;s going to be a major update and will most certainly take a bit of time, a lot of things have changed since including the way I code. That said, I plan to push it to GitHub as soon as I&#8217;ve got something solid so if you&#8217;re interested you can always follow along there. 

Last but not least, if you&#8217;re interested in adding your two cents or have suggestions, feel free to drop a comment below. As I mentioned above, it is still available for download so go ahead grab a copy or just view the demo and let me know what you think.

(Oh and no need to comment on the code needing to be stripped, reformatted and brought up to date &#8211; that&#8217;s already #1 on the list.)
