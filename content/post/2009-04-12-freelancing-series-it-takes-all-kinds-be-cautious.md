_This article was originally published on Papertree Design in April of 2009 during my first year of freelancing. It now makes more sense that it appear on my personal site, moved here October 26, 2011_

Midway through putting together an article on &#8220;the paperwork&#8221; I found myself running down quite a few interesting situations that have come up over the past year, many of them providing the very reasons my contracts, bids, etc undergo constant updates and refreshing.

As part of the series I think it is important that I share some of the situations that have helped me learn to &#8220;do it right&#8221;, so here I thought that it would be kind of fun to share a few stories/encounters with you and then open it up to hear some of your own experiences in freelancing. 

I am not simply suggesting that you run the other way when you encounter these particular types of situation, rather that you be cautious and not let your vision be clouded by a clients pitch of the windfall to come. Call these red flags or warning signs if you would like. 

### I&#8217;m Looking for a Partner

No you are not, you are looking for someone you is going to work with you at hugely discounted rates and/or for free because you have managed to sell them on the _I&#8217;m looking for a partner line_. Listen, I am all for entrepreneurship, I am all about exploring opportunity, but be wary when you hear this come out of a potential clients mouth. 

I am not exactly sure how things work elsewhere but around here when someone is truly looking for a partner in a new business venture there are normally many discussions, a bit of paperwork and certainly a signature or two to follow.

I am not saying to turn and run every time you hear this uttered but I am suggesting that you use common sense. Sit and listen to what they are pitching and if you honestly think that this is something that has potential for you then suggest a meeting and see where that leads. If they are suggesting that you become a partner and you are willing to provide them the work at a discounted or free rate in return for that partnership then treat the arrangement as what it is, a business arrangement and make them do the same. You will eventually find, more often than not, that there is no real opportunity or partnership that presents itself other than the opportunity for you to give someone a discount.

### It Will Look Great In Your Portfolio

This is a story I love and yes this really happened. First to lead into this, I understand the need for a few pieces in your portfolio and yes I understand that is especially attractive for a college student to get this opportunity. However I don&#8217;t see any reason that a college student should be doing work, outside of a class project, for free. Anyhow on to the story. 

I received an email one morning in a similar fashion to many of the emails I receive. _I need a quote on a website._ I followed my normal procedure, got in touch with the client, started to explore and learn a bit about the client and what exactly the project requires. This particular client was a **A small startup lending company specializing in providing funding for small business.** (Keep that in mind.) They dropped the we don&#8217;t have a lot of money for the project. Let me just say that I don&#8217;t ever let this line alone discourage me because more often than not they do have the money and they are in fact willing to pay what your work is worth, you just need to let them know why it is worth what it is.

Moving on. Being a small business myself, it sounded rather interesting. For the most part all of our correspondence was professional, seemed to be legitimate and thus I put together a quote for the client and emailed it off. A few hours passed by and I received an email in reply. 

> Well actually I was really looking for someone who was willing to do this for free and in return use it in their portfolio.

Wait, what? At any time during our talk did I give you the impression that I did this as a hobby? I believe we even covered the fact that I was technically a small business, see the relation? So by putting together a quote you thought that I meant I was going to spend the time on a detailed project scope document and then scribble $0.00 at the bottom? And wait a second aren&#8217;t you a company that specializes in helping small business, is this how that works? Last thing, as a financial company are you really telling me that you can&#8217;t even afford to foot the bill for your own website?

Of course I responded professionally, explained that this was my full time job, my business and that I was not in the position to do the work for free so I would have to respectfully decline.

To which I received the single line reply, _That&#8217;s ok, I&#8217;ll just find someone who will._

Smart move or not, out the door with the professionalism because the tone of this reply got me heated. Having taken the time to breath I somewhat politely let this arrogant knob know exactly how I felt about the way he had handled this entire interaction. Sad thing is, he wins, because he will in fact find someone willing to do it for free.

### You&#8217;re Gonna Be a Huge Star

Ok that might be an exaggeration, but you are definitely going to hear &#8220;This could be a big opportunity for you.&#8221; more than once during the span of your freelance career, especially if your client contact has any type of sales background whatsoever. At this point the client is trying to sell you on a discounted price for them. Trust me it&#8217;s going to get you and you are going to find yourself contemplating slashing a few numbers off that quote.

This is not to say that this is an immediate red flag or that they are going to be a bad client. For most I think it is just &#8220;in their blood&#8221;. You have to remember that they are trying to run a business as well. In most cases a good client is going to understand that while you see that this may be a potential door to many more clients to follow, you are not in the position to offer a discount based on that presumption. 

Again here I would examine the weight behind that pitch, if you feel that offering a discount will most certainly land you this client and there is in fact good reason to think that by working with them you will be opening the doors to many new clients to come then it might be something that you want to consider. This is your choice. My point here is don&#8217;t let yourself get wrapped up in think that fame and fortune is about to come pouring throughout the door simply because this person has a few _friends in high places_. 

In closing. Be cautious, don&#8217;t let yourself get caught up in the clients pitch to you when bidding a new project. Examine each opportunity and make sound business decisions. Ideally you want to work with clients who are respectful of your pricing, professional opinion and the seriousness of your career as a freelancer. If they start off treating you as a hobbyist, working from home in your PJ&#8217;s, then more than likely they will continue to treat you that way throughout the life of the project regardless of whether or not money changes hands. 

You are going to stumble a few times throughout the life of your freelance career, you are going to find yourself questioning your decisions and your ability to really _make it as a freelancer_. Don&#8217;t let it discourage you, treat each stumble as a learning experience and do it right the next time. Adapt the way you do business and move on because just when you think you have covered it all, a situation will present itself that causes your to rethink your strategy.
