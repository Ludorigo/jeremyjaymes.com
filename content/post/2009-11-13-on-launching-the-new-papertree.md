A few posts back I decided to be open and critique the previous redesign of PapertreeDesign.com. In that post I also mentioned that I had started rethinking my choices almost immediately and would be updating the site as soon as I felt it was ready. Well the time has come and I would love for you to check it out. You can start by checking out this [brief overview][1] of the project and then move on to reading this post [_Today Marks a New Beginning_][2].

Enjoy and let me know what you think.
