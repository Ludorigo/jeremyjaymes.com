I am at an interesting point in my solo journey which started just around two years ago. I am winding down on 1 or two projects and have no future projects schedule at this point, something that has not happened during my entire two year freelance career. I believe it is partly by design but entirely _my fault_. Regardless I am embracing it, looking forward to it and planning to take advantage of it by creating a fork in the road.

You see I have spent the better part of the last two years working non-stop, I just mentioned the other day that I even managed to squeeze in some work time on Christmas day of all days. Any personal projects have been late night endeavors and while I have released on of them (Charlene theme for WordPress), I haven&#8217;t really made anything substantial of it.

Two years of non-stop work coupled with a few recent project related events has left me feeling a bit burnt on the situation. As a matter of fact in the weeks past I have more than once contemplated making a drastic career move.

Having gathered my wits I realized that may not be necessary. Instead I am going to enter a short (possibly extended) period that I have jokingly referred to semi-retirement in which I will try to explore new avenues and opportunities. 

I am not, at this point, exactly sure how long this &ldquo;semi-retirement&rdquo; will last. I will continue to support my current clients and if a really interesting project comes along I will more than likely jump at the opportunity but for now I will be concentrating elsewhere.

My first focus. I will be spending the better part of at least the first week digging deeper into WordPress. WordPress a platform that I have used almost daily for the better part of the last 4 years is something that interests me greatly. (It does account for about 95% of my client work). Themes, articles, snippets, you name it I will be working on it.

The utimate goal is to begin creating an income that allows me more time to spend with my son, more time to explore a life _outside of work_ and some much needed time to dive into the remodel of an old farm house.

Should be a fun ride!
