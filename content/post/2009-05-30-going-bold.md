This is going to be quick and painless, as you can see I have redesigned Viral Thinking. It&#8217;s now bigger and bolder! The thought behind this redesign is to take one last stab at making something out of this blog and hopefully the big, bold and in your face approach will inspire me enough to do so.

The focus ahead or as I see it happening is to be mainly on business and entrepreneurship, just as it always has but with a few new projects and ideas on the way I should have plenty to talk about.

So get ready, fire up those Rss readers and stay tuned for the next installment.
