I am looking forward to the year 2009 and what it will bring to me in terms of life, business and new opportunities. As I prepare to reshape my freelancing career, create new income streams and explore new opportunity, I also plan to &#8220;Rethink Viral Thinking&#8221;. It is time for this blog to live up to what I once thought to be a very ingenious idea and rather catchy name. In order to this I want to get people involved so what is to follow is a series of Topic Lists and Polls, each of which I would like to get a general audience involved in disucssing. I will use your reactions, ideas and suggestions as well as the poll data to form a more exciting and useful space here on Viral Thinking. <!--more-->

To get us started [here is the first list of topics][1], read, share expand upon and enjoy!
