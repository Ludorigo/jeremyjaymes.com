What does the New Year mean to you? Sure it probably means a long night ahead for some of us and for others it simply means closing out the books for the year past. The date changes on the calendar, but really it&#8217;s a day like any other. Why is it that so many seem to think that it simply being a new year will have such a drastic change on their lives. They rush out to make resolutions, they crowd the gym, and they quite smoking only to find themselves right back where they started 6 months from now?

Yes the New Year holds some excitement for me, but is it really a clean slate? After putting some time and thought into it I decided that we should start to look at each day as if it where the new year. We should carry that same excitement and enthusiasm with us regardless. Each new day should be a clean slate where you strive to be a better you, a smarter you and a more accomplished you. Then perhaps we would start to see the change we were looking for when making those resolutions.

So I ask what is the New Year to you?
