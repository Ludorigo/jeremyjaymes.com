Deciding to make the switch back to WordPress was oddly difficult for me to do. I say that only because I&#8217;m very comfortable with WordPress development so it shouldn&#8217;t have been such a decision. None the less I finally pulled the trigger deciding that with the coming release of 3.1 that I would still be able to &#8220;blog&#8221; the way I wanted to (the tumblr way) and I&#8217;d have a platform for going a little more in depth from time to time. 

That leads me to why I even started thinking about the change in the first place. <!--more-->For one I have decided the I will jump back into writing a bit more, be it because I recently started working on a degree in my spare time which has rekindled my desire to write or be it that I got tangled in a new years resolution. None the less I wasn&#8217;t 100% sure that tumblr was the best place to make that happen even though it makes everything else I&#8217;ll be doing so much easier. The second reason has to do with comments. For the life of me I just getting get my head around making comments function the way I wanted them to on Tumblr. While a lot of people are tossing the idea of comments to the wayside for the simpler tweet reactions, I still very much appreciate the comments the my post generate from time to time. In my opinion the comments often become more important than the article itself.

That&#8217;s it, back to WordPress.
