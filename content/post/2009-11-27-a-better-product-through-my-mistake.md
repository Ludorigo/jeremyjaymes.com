One thing that I am not terribly afraid of when approaching my own business is the thought of making mistakes. In fact over the past ten years I have made mistakes in business on a fairly frequent basis, some that have certainly cost me money. Call it lack of experience but none the less it doesn’t bother me, I am ok with the thought of failure. Still to this day.

The reason I tend to be embracing of failure is because when I look back at the failures I have had, I can not think of a single instance that has not taught me something. Not a single instance that has not helped me to improve the next time around.

In all honesty I would say that I have learned more from a single failure than I have from a handful of successful attempts. If you are not experiencing failure, no matter how minute, then you are not pushing yourself to take the necessary risks. It is the necessary risks that will help you to move forward and take the next step.

Sure you would rather not make it habit to consistently fail in what you do. You would prefer that the success far out weight the failure, but learn to embrace the times you do make mistakes. Don’t give up because there is one bump in the road. Take that bump and learn to mold it into something more useful for the future.

Failure can be harnessed as a lesson which in turn teaches you how to do it right the next time around. Failure shapes a better product and a better business.
