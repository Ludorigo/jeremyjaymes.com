I wanted to send out a brief post concerning the status of this site. I have recently been overcome what can best be described as a Viral Thinking overload, meaning my plate is full and spilling out unto the floor. It&#8217;s an exciting place to be. So Viral Thinking has had a brief lapse in regularity but I will be back posting before the days end. I have several exciting posts sitting in limbo right now that need to be polished before they make their debut so stay tuned. Some of the topics I will be covering are; Keeping a Personal Journal, Outsourcing Your Weakness and the intimidating prospect of creating a business plan (or several in my case).

I will not leave you without provide some useful information however  so take the time to head over to one of my favorite blogs and check out the first few of a 10 part series dealing with [simplifying and organizing your use of social media platforms][1], by  Muhammad Saleem.

Consider this the first post in the return of Viral Thinking
