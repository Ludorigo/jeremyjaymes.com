I have been tapping away at my keyboard all morning trying to form a decent, coherent article discussing the direction of Viral Thinking for the year 2009. Due to a pot of coffee I will be doing no such thing, however I was able to put together quite a long list of topics that I would like to explore in the future. Without further ado, here is that list. Please leave your thoughts on these topics below. (For more information on why I am doing this please see this post [here][1].) <!--more-->

Using Twitter As a Customer Support Platform

Practical Uses For Twitter Search

Structured Office Setting Or Remote Employees

Where Is Your Business at the Close of 2009?

To Follow Or Not To Follow (On Twitter)

Where Has Your Target Market Gone?

The Future of Social Media and The Next &#8220;Big Thing&#8221;

Personal Branding at the Company Level

Why Your Blog Goes Unnoticed

The Success of Viral Thinking

Ahh the last one there is added as an encouraging note, I do in fact see myself writing that very post sometime in the year 2009. Nothing wrong with having vision. Anyhow think about these topics and generate your own ideas below, I would love to hear what you have to say. Considered this the first of many blog topic lists to come as I look towards the future of Viral Thinking.
