It&#8217;s been awhile since I wrote on the topic of blogging itself but finding myself skimming through [Copyblogger][1] this morning it got my mind working. (Thanks to the comment below from Phil Lucas, this is now a live link to the particular story I was reading when inspiration struck that lead to the writing of this article.) For some reason the question popped into my head, &#8220;Who gives a damn about what I write?&#8221; No I am not expressing my depression for lack of readers over here at Viral Thinking I am simply brainstorming, trying to figure out who it is that &#8220;gives a damn about what I write&#8221;. Why do I think it is important that I know this and why is it that you to should know this? Simply put, if you can&#8217;t answer this question in one form or another then you are wasting your time. Alright that&#8217;s a little harsh, plenty of us write for our own good without really worrying about whether or not anyone cares to read it. I am referring to those of use that are out here writing with the hope to bring in the traffic, market or sell a product and just plain make something of their blog. For you, your blog is a product whether you like to admit it or not and as is with any product, you need to know who your customers are.

So are looking to bring in the casual reader who is just looking for a little relief from the daily grind and more apt to skim. Or are you focused on the reader desparately searching for the next big idea that is going to catapult their business into the realm of success overnight and is more apt to hang on your every brilliant word. Don&#8217;t know? Figure it out and then tailor your product (writing style) to appeal.

How focused are you? Are you looking to provide content to one elite group of people who fully understand the ins and outs of your niche, or are looking to appeal to those informed and those interested. Let&#8217;s say for instance the topic of Nanotechnology. You are an expert on the subject and all you really want to do is content with others in the same boat, that&#8217;s your market. So go for it, use all of the fancy terms and technical terms you would like. But lets for a moment say that you are looking to appeal to a reader more like myself, I might be interested but if you start throwing out the big words too soon, chances are I will loose interest pretty quickly and go searching elsewhere. Start me out slow, &#8220;dumb it down a bit&#8221; as they say, real me in and then wow me. Bottom line is learn to relate to your reader. This should be one of the easiest things in the world because chances are if you are interested enough to write about it then you are interested enough to read. YOU ARE PART OF THE MARKET so relate to your peers, just like you would anywhere else, whether it be the halls of a prestigious university or the dark corners of the neighborhood tavern. Make it personal and find a way to relate.

You have a ton of great ideas and a passion to share them, but if you don&#8217;t focus on appealing to the &#8220;people who give a damn&#8221; about your brilliance or lack there of then you will forever being asking yourself who gives a damn about what I write.
