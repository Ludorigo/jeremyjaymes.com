It&#8217;s interesting to think about how articles like the two directly below will start to shape our client&#8217;s thoughts on their approach to web strategy. The call for mobile design has been building for quite a while and (from my point of view) really seemed to pick up momentum in the latter part of 2010. That&#8217;s not to say that it hasn&#8217;t been on the _our_ minds for quite some time but I feel like we will soon start to see our clients more frequently questioning the need for a mobile strategy.

To further enforce this, and I&#8217;m not one to subscribe to the &#8220;web design trends for 20XX&#8221;, but I have seen mobile mentioned more than once as one of the upcoming &#8220;trends&#8221;. We know that many of our clients are quite aware of these site publishing &#8220;trends&#8221; list and whether we like to admit it or not it can often influence the initial conversation. That coupled with hard facts is going to be difficult to ignore. 

I would of course have to disagree that the descriptive term for this should be &#8220;trend&#8221; but rather the changing face of the web, how we access information and approach marketing. That&#8217;s not to say that traditional access will be ignored but rather that we&#8217;ll all need to more seriously consider our clients want or need to deliver experiences that are formatted across multiple platforms. In my personal opinion [this is a good place to start][3].
