If your company/brand is engaging customers through social media, blogging, video etc. it&#8217;s going to happen, especially if you are a well recognized brand. There is going to be some flak, some negative feedback, and what some would refer to as haters. So what do you do when negative feedback drops right in your lap?

To approve or not to approve. I am of course referring to those times when you have the ability to moderate what is being said, but I think it applies even to those instances where you do not have that control. My vote&#8230; unless it is completely inappropriate (i.e. riddled with foul language etc) approve it. And then respond.

Why? Because not only are you given the chance to engage the angry or dissatisfied &#8220;customer&#8221; and possibly resolve the issue, but you are also showing your other consumers and potential clients how well you are willing to work with dissatisfied clients. You are showing them that this space you have created and thus your &#8220;product&#8221; is in fact one that is actually here to engage and listen, learn and improve for them. That I think is what the majority of the consumers engaging products, brands and companies via Social Media are looking for.

Consider for a moment how someone in the restaurant industry must deal with an angry client (speaking from experience). For one, there is no where to hide, you can&#8217;t run from the angry customer when you are in the middle of a packed dining room, all eyes on you. You have no choice, you have to deal with that angry customer right here and right now, and you damn sure don&#8217;t want to be disrespectful to one when 30 or 40 other families are looking on to see how this pans out. Sure you want to keep it low key, but the bottom line is you are going to in most cases have to deal with this publicly.

So how does the server who comes under attack over undercooked food deal with it. Be respectful and understanding, calm them and find out what you can do to make this client happy again. In every case possible you want this customer to come back two weeks from now telling the next manager on duty:

&#8220;You know, even though the food was awful the last time I was here, I decided to bring my family back because of the way so and so handled the situation. They convinced me that it was worth it to give you guys another chance.&#8221;

Now sure that&#8217;s not going to work out every time. So the next thing you want to do is control the situation. Show your other customers that although this particular customer is very unhappy, you are dealing with it in a very respectful manner and trying your very best to turn the situation around. Because although they may be perfectly happy with their meal and may not let the angry customers opinion of his meal influence their own, you can be sure that they will let your treatment of the angry customer impact their opinion if you do not handle it professionally.

The point I am trying to make here is that your customers are engaging you in these spaces because they are looking to believe that you will in fact get involved, be proactive if you will. So if it is your choice to provide your customers with these platforms, then perhaps consider treating as if you do not have the option to hide. As if you are in a crowded dinning room, all eyes on you.
