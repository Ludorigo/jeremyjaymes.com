Enough already, but I think I have finally come back around and settled. Call it what you want minimal, old, plain; in the end this is me.

Sure I love techy gadgets, shiny toys and I can even design things using color or subtle gradients, but in the end this is the style that I prefer. The style I believe I am <del>good</del> getting better at each and every day. It&#8217;s the style I study and it excites me. I like a well designed book, I prefer my newfound antique desk lamp and if it wasn&#8217;t so damn easy to use a digital camera I would always default to my ancient Minolta complete with 60&#8217;s style should strap.

This site is supposed to be me, correct? So it is.

There is quite a bit more, I assure you and would encourage you to say hello.
