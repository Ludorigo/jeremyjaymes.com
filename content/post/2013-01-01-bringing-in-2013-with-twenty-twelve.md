It&#8217;s been a goal of mine for some time to get back to where I started, building with WordPress and writing about the process. (Well, to really get back to where I started you&#8217;d have to include a bout with Cube Cart but I&#8217;d rather not.) I realize it&#8217;s a bit cliche to be writing about goals on the first day of the new year but I figured now is as good a time as any to really try and focus on making this happen.

I will of course continue to work as Papertree on all of the various WordPress and non-WordPress related projects that myself and some very reliable &#8220;partners&#8221; are lucky to be a part of, but this year I&#8217;d like to jump back into a few strictly WordPress development projects all on my own.

So with that, I decided to ring in the New Year with a quick little child theme taking the new Twenty Twelve theme for a spin. It&#8217;s nothing fancy but I think it will serve it&#8217;s purpose well. I have to say that Twenty Twelve is worth a look, if for no other reason but to learn. Along with the new &#8220;look&#8221; you&#8217;ll see that I&#8217;ve also set up a [services page][1] (strictly WordPress) detailing the type of project I&#8217;m looking to get involved in. So if you&#8217;re heading into the new year with a project that requires a reliable and experienced WordPress developer, drop me a message and we can chat.

Happy New Year!
