Recently I was given the opportunity to attend a local BNI chapter meeting as a guest. For those of you that are unfamiliar with what BNI is, I will give you my brief explanation from what I was able to gather at the meeting. [BNI][1] is an international business networking group organized into chapters. Each chapter is made up of unique members from various professions. The important part of this organization is that only one specialty area of profession is allowed per group. For example, Chapter A has only one electrician in the group meaning that he or she is not competing with another electrician for business or &#8220;referalls&#8221; from other group members. If you find yourself interested in joining a local chapter and find that they already have a representative for your particular profession then you will be referred to another local chapter.

Ok so you are thinking, wow that&#8217;s great so I can get the business of the 20 or 30 other members and then what, I am just sitting through meetings every week when I could be out looking for other business? Not at all, because remember that each of those 30 or so other members might have 30 or so other acquantinces, 5 of whom are in need of your services immediately. So are you starting to see the bigger picture here? Technically your referrals could snowball infinitely.

And the benefits do not stop at referrals. Ideas are openly discussed and shared. I can not stress how important it is to surround yourself with people who have ambitions similar to your own when it comes to business and entrepreneurship. These very meetings are encouraging you to think virally. And the beauty of it is that amongst friends (as many of them seem to be) they can be very honest with each other. You can find out if that new marketing idea you have been back and forth on is a bust long before you put the plan into motion.

Beyond that they spend a portion of each meeting on business education. They require that each week you get a closer look into the profession of one of the other members. In a way this acts not only as an education to the group but also as a &#8220;sales pitch&#8221; for the presenter.

Testimonials are encouraged to be shared openly. For example in the meeting that I had the pleasure of attending one member had sent a sub in his place (which is required). His choice for a sub was actually one of his clients and another member of the local business community. This was a genius marketing strategy and her testimonial was amazing.

Ok so obviously I am very excited to continue learning about this group and others like it. The seemingly endless benefits of belonging far outshine the cost in my mind. I hope that you to will take the next opportunity you have to take a closer look at a local networking group and consider adding it to your portfolio of business tools.
