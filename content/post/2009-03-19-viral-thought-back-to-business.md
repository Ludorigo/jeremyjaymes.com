Back to business, no really back to business. I read back through some of my previous articles talking about focusing your blog, &#8220;just writing&#8221;, keeping on your content etc. etc. Then I realized that I seriously fail to practice what I preach. Slacker!

It&#8217;s been a busy start to the year to say the least but no excuses. If anything the past few projects that I have had the pleasure to be involved with have been a real eye opener to me. Day in and day out I started to realize the amount of above and beyond time I put into client work when I really start to get excited about it. Emails, ideas, phones calls. Hell you could have a look at any number of emails I have written to clients and start to realize that I write tutorials not emails.

Bottom line is I feel like I share a lot of good ideas and advice with clients, in fact I help put it into action and see the results. The unfortunate part, I don&#8217;t often put the practices into action myself. I also don&#8217;t share enough with the wider audience, the damn reason I started a blog like this in the first place.

So that&#8217;s it time to put some of my advice into practice for myself, back to business!
