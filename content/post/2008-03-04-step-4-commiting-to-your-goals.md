This is possibly one of the greatest challenges I look to overcome while achieving my goal of $500 a month in sales. All along I have remained committed to the overall success of my business but failed to set and realize one goal at a time. This is especially important when the owner of the company is also often the only employee working full time toward the new businesses success. Often times I think that the big picture becomes overwhelming and we set out to accomplish to many things at once. It is import to remain aware of the &#8220;big picture&#8221;, however I feel that success is best realized by setting and achieving one major goal at a time. Not to say that managing the business in all areas from design and production to financial well being gets tossed by the wayside while I look to increase online sales as it is all very important to your success. I am simply saying that setting a milestone and seeing it through is often times the best way to attain that &#8220;big picture&#8221;. Organization and prioritizing now become key elements in your daily business activities.

Set a goal and stay committed.
