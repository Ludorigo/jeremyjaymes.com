Reinventing your personal brand, is it detrimental to create a personal brand around an alias or pen name? A question I have had to seriously consider as I look to the next step in my career as an entrepreneur. I would love to hear what others think.

While employed full time I saw reason and benefit to begin focusing on the creation of a personal brand. I knew that my time with the company was limited and I was to soon find myself back in the arms of entrepreneurship. Developing a brand in preparation seemed to make sense. Now I do not envision myself as a rock star or film actor trying to salvage some bit of privacy from my adoring fans but for one reason or another I decided to go with a &#8220;pen name&#8221;. It was also not in any way necessary to hide my moonlighting from my employer as he encouraged it. It was simply because I felt this a more brandable and memorable name. The name itself is a slight variation on a family name so it is not completely fictitious. My first name is in fact Jeremy. (I did consider going with Tyler Durden for a short period.) I make no effort to hide my given name, as you can just as easily find it on the about page of any website I lay claim to, however the alias is that which I use on several of my social profiles. The problem I am having is in deciding if it makes sense to move forward with this &#8220;pen name&#8221; as I push try to advance my career and business. Any thoughts?<!--more-->

**A few disclaimers:**

I am not looking to sign of on anything contractual with my alias.

My business name is separate and no part of my name appears in the title, however the is a very blurred line between how my clients recognize it, often we are one and the same. I would like it to remain that way.

**The Questions**

Do you see an alias as harmful in a business setting?

Would a personal brand formed around an Alias lead to awkward explanations more often then it is worth? (I have had to explain once or twice.)

Is it to late to turn back now and how would reinventing hurt my forward progress this far in?

Any examples of someone who has made this work for them in this particular environment?

Basically I am looking for some guidance, a discussion on the pros and cons. If you have any thoughts please feel free to voice theme below.

_For reference &#8211; The alias is Jeremy Delane, my given name is Vossman._
