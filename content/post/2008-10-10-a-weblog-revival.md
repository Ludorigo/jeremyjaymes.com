With the present state of things around here, and by here I mean the part of the world that the news seems to cover most often lately, I think that it is as good a time as any to revive this blog and really get it headed in the right direction. Why? Because it&#8217;s gonna take a little Viral Thinking to get us out of this mess and turned back around. I have a lot of ideas on what direction to take with the content, design and overall concept of the blog but I am not 100% positive that any of them are the direction I should choose at this point, so in the fashion of everything else that I tend to do I will get started and let it take shape on it&#8217;s own.

The first thing I am considering is a redesign, [imagine that][1]? Don&#8217;t get me wrong, for some reason I love where it is at right now but I am not sure that it is the most reader friendly format, your thoughts?

Second thing on my mind is the direction I shold take with the content of the blog. What would be most useful to the reader, given the overall concept?

In the natural order of things the next thing would be&#8230; how to really get people involved in the site. The most important element to my purpose for the blog would be reader interaction thus &#8220;viral thinking&#8221;. So, how do I get you involved?

Stay tuned, it&#8217;s all coming up rather quickly, but first an upgrade of this WordPress Installation is in order!
