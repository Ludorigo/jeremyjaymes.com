How many times have you found yourself getting ready to start a big WordPress development project that requires a well-thought-out reorganization if not a complete restructuring of existing site content?

You&#8217;ll likely start by taking inventory of what you have, carefully organizing all existing content into topic areas using content type labels or taxonomy.

If you&#8217;re anything like me you this is right around the time that you start feeling anxious and overwhelmed, staring at content, trying to figure out where to start.

**What if this process could be made easier by starting inside of WordPress?**

<!--more-->

In a recent project we started by exporting a copy of the existing site content. We then set up a &#8220;clean&#8221;, default installation of WordPress and imported the content. This is where we would start, and by going completely bare with the installation there was only one thing we could focus on &#8211; content.

Next, we installed the Custom Page Labels Plugin. We dove in, reviewing each piece of content,  fleshing out a structure, using Custom Page Labels to tag each piece of content with it&#8217;s respective type or taxonomy.

For example:

| Page                         | Label                       |
| ---------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| ABC Widget                   | Products                    |
| ABC Widget Technical Details | Products &#8212; ABC Widget |
| XYZ Widget                   | Products                    |
| XYZ Widget Technical Details | Products &#8212; XYZ Widget |

<small><em>You might do this in conjunction with a page/child page structure.</em></small>

Easy to visualize, easy to identify within the admin pages list, and easy to edit when you change your mind.

This is only a small part of your information architecture project but it does prove to be an interesting and unexpected use case for the [Custom Page Labels plugin][1].
