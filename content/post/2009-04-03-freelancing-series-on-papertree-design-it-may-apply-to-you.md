A few weeks ago I launch the &#8220;Pitfalls of Freelancing&#8221; series on Papertree Design and for some reason overlooked the fact that it may apply to many of you and that I had made no effort to announce it here.

It&#8217;s a bit slow in the making but the plan is to cover everything from making the break from employment to completing the first gig you land (and all that falls between). I hope to cover some ideas on marketing, working with clients, proposals and contracts etc etc.

Yes of course this will be geared somewhat at the freelance designer/web developer, but I am hoping to be a bit general in covering these topics. I hope that it might apply and be quite interesting to anyone planning to break off from that day to day and step out on their own.

Feel free to go check it out, starting with the announcement [The Pitfalls of Freelancing: A Year In Review][1]
