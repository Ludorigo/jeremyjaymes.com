Currently accepting new WordPress development projects for June 2014. 

## Already working with a designer?

I will work with your team to develop the design that you&#8217;ve put so much work into planning, polishing, and perfecting. You can feel confident that I will exercise the same care and precision in turning your concept into a fully functioning website powered by WordPress.

  * Flexibility
  * Speed
  * Security
  * Responsive
  * HTML5

A typical project will take approximately 2.5 weeks to complete and starts at $2500.

## Square One?

Myself and one of my design partners will work with you closely to take your project from idea to reality with a process of discovery, design, and development. 

Cost will vary depending on the unique needs of the project. Once I fully understand your project I will work with you to custom tailor a solution that meets your business requirements.

## Frameworks, Child Themes, and other free or commercially available themes?

I have extensive experience working with frameworks such as Genesis and Hybrid as well as other free/commercially available themes. Feel free to drop me a message so we can discuss your needs.

## Other

  * General maintenance & troubleshooting
  * Site planning
  * Training & general consulting
  * Commerical theme projects

Portfolio will be updated soon.
